# Final Project

It's time to take the skills you've learned in this course and apply them to
a real project. We've gone ahead and created a very fancy looking site but
there are a number of accessibility issues that could be improved. Do your
best to fix as many as you can and if you get stuck or need a hint you can
check out the [answers file](ANSWERS.md).
